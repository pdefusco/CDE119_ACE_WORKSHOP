# Part 6: Conclusions and Next Steps

Congratulations for making it to the end of this Hands On Lab! We hope you enjoyed using CDE first hand.

### Conclusions

CDE is the Cloudera Data Engineering Service, a containerized managed service for Spark and Airflow.

CDP Data Engineering is the only cloud-native service purpose-built for enterprise data engineering teams. Building on Apache Spark, Data Engineering is an all-inclusive data engineering toolset that enables orchestration automation with Apache Airflow, advanced pipeline monitoring, visual troubleshooting, and comprehensive management tools to streamline ETL processes across enterprise analytics teams.

Data Engineering is fully integrated with Cloudera Data Platform, enabling end-to-end visibility and security with SDX as well as seamless integrations with CDP services such as Data Warehouse and Machine Learning. Data Engineering on CDP powers consistent, repeatable, and automated data engineering workflows on a hybrid cloud platform anywhere.

### CDE Relevant Projects

If you are exploring or using CDE today you may find the following tutorials relevant:

* [Spark 3 & Iceberg](https://github.com/pdefusco/Spark3_Iceberg_CML): A quick intro of Time Travel Capabilities with Spark 3.

* [Simple Intro to the CDE CLI](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_CLI_Simple): An introduction to the CDE CLI for the CDE beginner.

* [CDE CLI Demo](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_CLI_demo): A more advanced CDE CLI reference with additional details for the CDE user who wants to move beyond the basics.

* [CDE Resource 2 ADLS](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDEResource2ADLS): An example integration between ADLS and CDE Resource. This pattern is applicable to AWS S3 as well and can be used to pass execution scripts, dependencies, and virtually any file from CDE to 3rd party systems and viceversa.

* [Using CDE Airflow](https://github.com/pdefusco/Using_CDE_Airflow): A guide to Airflow in CDE including examples to integrate with 3rd party systems via Airflow Operators such as BashOperator, HttpOperator, PythonOperator, and more.

* [GitLab2CDE](https://github.com/pdefusco/Gitlab2CDE): a CI/CD pipeline to orchestrate Cross-Cluster Workflows for Hybrid/Multicloud Data Engineering.

* [CML2CDE](https://github.com/pdefusco/cml2cde_api_example): an API to create and orchestrate CDE Jobs from any Python based environment including CML. Relevant for ML Ops or any Python Users who want to leverage the power of Spark in CDE via Python requests.

* [Postman2CDE](https://github.com/pdefusco/Postman2CDE): An example of the Postman API to bootstrap CDE Services with the CDE API.

* [Oozie2CDEAirflow API](https://github.com/pdefusco/Oozie2CDE_Migration): An API to programmatically convert Oozie workflows and dependencies into CDE Airflow and CDE Jobs. This API is designed to easily migrate from Oozie to CDE Airflow and not just Open Source Airflow.
